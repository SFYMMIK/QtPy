Update 1.3:

Compatibility: X.org bugs are now fixed

Update Changes: Realtime saving is now possible but only with the save button not Ctrl + s sadly

Update Forgotten Changes: i Forgot to change the version info from 1.2 to 1.3 in the program but it doesn't affect the usage in any way

Thanks To Everyones Support!
