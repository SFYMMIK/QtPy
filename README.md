2. **File Management:** Users can open, save, and save files with ease using the file menu or toolbar options. The IDE supports various file formats.
3. **Dark Mode:** QtPy IDE features a dark mode interface for reduced eye strain and improved readability in low-light environments.
4. **Directory Navigation:** Users can navigate through directories, open files, and folders directly from within the IDE, simplifying project management.
5. **Run Files:** The IDE allows users to run HTML files directly in the default web browser. It provides options for running Python files manually.
6. **Search Functionality:** QtPy IDE includes a search feature that enables users to search the web using their default browser directly from the IDE.
