# About smIDE

## Introduction
smIDE is a lightweight Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for coding in various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, and Python or any language you would want because of its undefined tabs!.

## Features
- **Tabbed Interface:** Easily manage and switch between multiple files with the tabbed interface.
- **File Operations:** Perform standard file operations like creating new files, opening existing files, saving, and saving as.
- **Dynamic Tabs:** Tabs dynamically update based on the selected language and file name.

## How to Use
1. **Creating a New File:**
   - After you have booted the program please click on one of the tabs even if its already chosen.
   - Then after clicking on the tab a new file is already created in the memory of the program so when you are ready to save just click the save button.

2. **Opening/Saving an Existing File:**
   - Click the "Open" button on the toolbar.
   - Choose a txt/All Files file to open.
   - after you have opened a file in your chosen tab when you click save it edits the file that is open and deletes everything inside and replaces it with what you have written in it.
   - but if you have opened a file but want to make another file from this file just click 'File' and then 'Save As'.

3. **Adding a New Tab:**
   - Click the "+ add Tab +" button on the toolbar.
   - Enter a name and select a language for the new tab.
   - You can just leave the 'Undefined' and it will save it as 'All Files' or type a valid language like html.

4. **Closing Tabs:**
   - Click the 'x' button on the tab to close it. You will be prompted to confirm the action.
